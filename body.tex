\section{Scope}

This Working Group is to review the DM provenance based on what is now
available in butler gen 3 and the DPPDized data model.

 Ideally this working group would convene and finish before the end of 2019.

\section{Responsibilities}

The Working Group (WG) has the following responsibilities:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Asses available provenance information in the current gen3 butler metadata registry
    \item Identify provenance gaps in the data model and how they should be filled.
    \item Classify the resulting provenance needs as critical (needed for commissioning), important (need for full ops) or nice to have.
\end{itemize}

This group is not intended to solve how missing provenance information should be added - this should fall the middleware group.
This group may of course suggest ways to gather/store such provenance information.

\section{Specific Tasks}

\subsection{ Asses Available Information}

This may have to be provided by the Middleware group based on he gen3 runs of HSC processing and the
resulting data model.

\subsection{Identify Gaps and needs}
The group should then identify use cases e.g' " can I find which PVIs used this calibration file " and determine if they can be answered with the existing metadata. This will obviously be best facilitated by someone very familiar with gen 3 butler.

In general the list of provenance requirement or  "use cases"  is the most important output of this group.
\subsection{Classify use cases}
The identified use cases need to be classified and that classification has to be agreed within DM - hence it may need to be in a formal document.



\section{Membership}

The proposed membership is:

\begin{itemize}
    \item
    \item Amanda Bauer (EPO Tucson; observer)
\end{itemize}


\section{Reporting}

The WG Chair shall report directly to the DM Project manager weekly.
