\newglossaryentry{Data Management} {name={Data Management}, description={The LSST Subsystem responsible for the Data Management System (DMS), which will capture, store, catalog, and serve the LSST dataset to the scientific community and public. The DM team is responsible for the DMS architecture, applications, middleware, infrastructure, algorithms, and Observatory Network Design. DM is a distributed team working at LSST and partner institutions, with the DM Subsystem Manager located at LSST headquarters in Tucson}}
\newglossaryentry{Data Management Subsystem} {name={Data Management Subsystem}, description={The Data Management Subsystem is one of the four subsystems which constitute the LSST Construction Project. The Data Management Subsystem is responsible for developing and delivering the LSST Data Management System to the LSST Operations Project}}
\newglossaryentry{Data Management System} {name={Data Management System}, description={The computing infrastructure, middleware, and applications that process, store, and enable information extraction from the LSST dataset; the DMS will process peta-scale data volume, convert raw images into a faithful representation of the universe, and archive the results in a useful form. The infrastructure layer consists of the computing, storage, networking hardware, and system software. The middleware layer handles distributed processing, data access, user interface, and system operations services. The applications layer includes the data pipelines and the science data archives' products and services}}
